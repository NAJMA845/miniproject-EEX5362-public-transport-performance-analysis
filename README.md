# Public Transportation Network Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates a **city bus network** using **discrete-event simulation** (Python + SimPy). It models:

- Multiple bus routes and stops
- Passenger arrivals and queueing
- Bus operations, capacity, and trips
- Performance metrics: waiting time, bus utilization, passenger throughput

This project is designed for **performance modeling and evaluation**, focusing on bottlenecks, latency, and resource utilization.

---

## Features
- Generates CSV files for passengers, buses, and queues.
- Visualizes queue lengths over time and passenger waiting time distributions.
- Configurable bus routes, stops, capacities, and arrival rates.
- Simulation duration configurable (default: 8 hours).
